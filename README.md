🛠️ What It Can Do (Functions Behind the Magic)

Overdue Tracker
🚨 Automatically shows which tasks are past due based on today’s date (=TODAY() + conditional formatting).

Completion Tracker with Data Bars
📊 Visual progress using Excel's Data Bars in the Completion % column.

Client Approval Toggle
✅ Easy Yes/No dropdown using Data Validation.

Story Points & Sprints
🌀 Agile-style estimation using dropdowns and formulas for better sprint planning.

Fixed Headers
🧷 Freezes top 3 header rows so you never lose track while scrolling.

Priority Tagging & Filters
🔺 Tasks are labeled by priority (High, Medium, Low) with color coding.

🧠 Use Cases
Freelancers & Small Teams
Stay on track with multiple clients and approvals.

Agile Sprint Planners
Track user stories, story points, and burn-down logic in a single sheet.

Personal Productivity
Even solo? Use it as your daily or weekly planner to monitor workload.

Managers
Keep your team aligned and check task status at a glance—no fancy software needed.

💡 Notes
Add your own categories or columns if your workflow needs more.

Works well with Trello or Notion too (manually sync).

Keep the “Search Match” helper column visible while setting up, then hide it if you want a cleaner look.
